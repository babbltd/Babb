Business can be viewed as a universal, ever extending process that originates from and is based on the individual trader. Such an entity may be an accredited person, a laborer, a corporation, or simply a Human engaged in the game of life. What makes them a Trader, and not a broker or some other type of intermediary, is their ownership of the asset or service being traded for. Chains of trade may be involved in any given swap of value but it's an entities Autonomy and sovereignty over the items being traded which confirms them as the Real Trader.

However complex the systems which emerge in time, the primacy of the Trader brings simplicity and strength to the operation of systems that support trading activities.
